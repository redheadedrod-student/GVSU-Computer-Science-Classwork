	<h2>General Description</h2>
		<p>netAnalyzer is a program that allows you to analyze a small social or similar network.  </p>
		<p>In the main panel the network can be visually inspected.  One can 
also drag and drop nodes to different locations.  Nodes are colored 
according to the tasks that are done.  The links are generally black.  
The only exception is when doing link prediction, predicted links are 
shown in red.  Besides manually moving the nodes, one can also choose 
from a variety of layouts to automatically place the nodes.  Look under 
the tab for Layouts for more information.</p>
		<p>The data is read in from files.  You can create and change these 
files using your favorite editor.  The program saves and loads networks 
using its own file format.  Networks can be imported, though using 
formats described under the File tab.</p>
		<p>A loaded network can be analyzed using several different metrics 
and algorithms.  These are in the tabbed box on the far left of the 
window.  Under the tabs, one can calculate a number of different metrics
 or they can find communities, influential nodes or predict nodes or 
links.  Click on the Tasks tab for more information.</p>
		<p>One can also have the netAnalizer randomly generate a network.  The
 user enters the desired parameters and the system generates a network 
based on the parameters entered.  For more information, click on the 
Generate tab.</p>

	<h2>Files</h2>
		<h3>opening and saving files</h3>
			<p>You can save and open files using the file menu.  If you make 
changes to a network you can choose to do a save (which saves it under 
the same name as it was opened under) or save as (where you can save a 
new copy under a new name).  You can choose any extension but it is best
 to stick with something like "txt" or "net".</p>
			<p>A saved file can later be opened using the open menu item.  
Networks are saved in a format that is particular to the netAnalyzer.  
They are text files so you can inspect them and even change them but if 
you do change them, it is likely that the netAnalyzer will not be able 
to read in the data correctly.  To create a new network, you first need 
to import the graph (see below) and perhaps import the attributes.  Once
 you done that, you can save the network and it will remember the nodes,
 links and their placement on the canvas.</p>
		<h3>importing graphs</h3>
			<p>You can import a graph using one of three formats.  The formats 
are described below.  You can sometimes obtain files already in one of 
these formats, create these files in an editor or convert them using a 
programming language or spreadsheet.  Examples of the formats are 
distributed with the software to help you correctly format a new file.</p>
		<h3>importing attributes</h3>
			<p>Attributes are properties of a node.  For example, if the network 
you are working on is a social network of people, the attributes could 
contain information like, age, phone number, monthly salary, etc.  The 
attributes are displayed in the <i>Node Properties</i> box when a node 
is selected on the canvas.  The attributes can also be used for node 
prediction, which is discussed under the section on tasks.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<h2>file formats</h2>
		<table><tbody><tr><td>
			<p>The formats for the graph and attribute files follow below.  In 
all cases, the delimiters are newline and space.  A new line is used to 
separate node information (for adjacency matrices and lists and for 
attributes) or edges (for edge lists).  Spaces separate items on the 
same line.  The formats below are represented by tables but really they 
are values separated by spaces.  All examples represent the graph to the
 right.</p>
		</td><td>
			<img src="netAnalyzer_files/xid-45939126_1.jpg">

		<ul>
			<li>
				<table><tbody><tr><td>
					<p><b>adjacency matrix: </b>An adjacency matrix is an <i>n by n</i>
 matrix of ones and zeros, where n is the number of nodes in the 
network.  The matrix to the right is the adjacency matrix for the 
network above.  Each row and column represent a node.  If there is a 
link between nodes <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> then a 1 is placed in the cell at the intersection of the i<sup>th</sup> and j<sup>th</sup> column.  Notice that node 0 is linked to both nodes 1 and 2 and that there are 1's in the column 1 and 2 of row 0.<br></p>
				</td><td>
					<table border="1"><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table>

				<table><tbody><tr><td>
					<p><b>adjacency list: </b>Unlike an adjacency matrix, an adjacency 
list does not have an entry for each potential link.  Instead it stores 
only the actual links that a node has.  The list is <i>n</i> lines long 
with a list of nodes on each line.  The first line lists all of the 
links for the first node and so on.  The list to the right is the 
adjacency list for the network above.  Notice that node 2 is connected 
to nodes 0, 1 and 3 which are the numbers on the line for node 2.<br><br></p>

				<table><tbody><tr><td>
					<p><b>edge list: </b>An edge list simply lists each edge on a 
separate line of the file.  The table to the right is only a partial 
representation of the edge list for the network.  It only lists the 
first three links, from 0 to 1, from 0 to 2 and from 1 to 2.<br><br><br><br><br></p>

				<table><tbody><tr><td>
					<p><b>attributes: </b>The layout for the attribute file is the 
traditional table layout, like a spreadsheet.  Each line represents a 
different node, with different attribute values separated by spaces.  
The first line is reserved for the descriptions of the attributes.  For 
the network on this page, each node has an id, name, age and height.  So
 node 0 is really Jill who is 26 years old, 164 cm. tall and has an id 
of 1.<br></p>

		<h2>Screen Elements</h2><p>The main window for netAnalyzer is separated into several function areas or elements.  Each is described below.</p>
			<h3>menu bar</h3><p>The menu bar has important tasks that are not 
done as often as some of the other elements.  Under file, you can open 
or save a network.  Import allows you to import a graph from a text file
 (see the Files tab for more information).  Edit allows you to select 
all of the data in the results box and copy it to the clipboard.  On the
 left side is the task box that allows you to do a number of helpful 
tasks (see Tasks tab).  The layout has several different methods to 
automatically rearrange the placement of the nodes.  Finally the 
generate menu allows you to generate random synthetic networks.</p>
			<h3>task box</h3><p>See the Task tab for more information about doing the various tasks.</p>
			<h3>network canvas</h3><p>The network canvas takes up the center of 
the window and is where the network is placed.  One can have the nodes 
automatically rearranged (see layouts) or can move them manually.  To 
move a node, move the mouse pointer to the center of the node and 
right-click.  With the button down, drag to the location you want to 
move it to and release the button.  Also when you click on a node it 
will display information about the node in the <i>node properties</i> box.</p>
			<h3>node properties</h3><p>Information about a node is displayed in 
the node properties box whenever a node is selected on the canvas or 
when it is selected in the <i>nodes</i> box.</p>
			<h3>nodes</h3><p>This box displays a list of the nodes in the network
 along with the name of the node if it is present in the attributes.  
One can scroll through the box and select a node.  That causes that 
nodes properties to be displayed in the node properties box and 
highlights the node in the network drawing on the canvas.</p>
			<h3>results</h3><p>The results box lists the results of the more 
recently completed task.  For instance, if you chose to calculate 
statistics these would show up in the results box.  If you chose to find
 communities the community assignments will be display in the results 
box (and so on).</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<p>There are 5 tasks that one can choose to apply to a network.  
These will provide you with information to help understand and analyze 
the network.  All of the tasks will update the Results box with the 
results of the task.  It may also update the network visual display by 
changing colors of nodes or links.</p>
			<h3>1 - metrics</h3>
				<p>There are a number of metrics that you can choose to calculate 
for the network.  Check the ones that you are interested in and press <i>calculate</i>.  The results will be placed in the results box where you can copy and paste them into another application if you wish.
				</p><ul>
					<li>density - percentage of links, i.e. number of actual links divided by total possible links.</li>
					<li>clusteringCoef - clustering coefficient is a measure of how 
tightly connected a nodes neighbors are.  Considering the subnetwork 
inscribed by a node and its neighbors, clustering coefficient is the 
number of links divided by total possible links.</li>
					<li>degreeDist - a list of the degrees for each node, sorted in ascending order</li>
					<li>avgPathLen - the average of geodesic distance (shortest path) of all possible node pairs.</li>
					<li>diameter - largest geodesic distance.</li>
					<li>powerLawExp - the degree distribution of scale free networks follow a power curve where p(k)=1/k<sup>&#945;</sup> where 2 &lt; &#945; &lt; 3.  Checking this box fits the network to a power law curve and calculates the value of &#945;</li>
					<li>open triads - counts the number of open triangles, which are groups of three nodes connected by two links.</li>
					<li>closed triads - counts the number of closed triangles -- three nodes connected by three links.</li>
					<li>rawComm - metric that estimates the number of communities that a node could belong to.</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
			<h3>2 - find communities</h3>
				<p>Communities in networks are groups of nodes that are tightly 
linked.  A set of good communities are ones where there are many links 
within the communities and few between them.  This uses the CHI 
algorithm by Scripps and Trefftz.  Parameters include <i>k</i>, <i>&#955;1</i>, <i>&#955;2</i>, <i>&#955;3</i>.  Enter the number of communities you wish to find in the box labeled <i>k</i>.</p>  <p>The
 &#955; values control the kinds of communities the algorithm finds.  There 
are three types of violations that the algorithm tries to minimize: 
missing neighbors (E<sub>mn</sub>: links between communities), extraneous nodes (E<sub>en</sub>: non-links within communities) and overlap (E<sub>ol</sub>nodes placed in multiple communities).  &#955;1 applies to E<sub>mn</sub>, &#955;2 applies to E<sub>en</sub>, &#955;3 applies to E<sub>ol</sub>.  A higher &#955; value results in a lower value of the corresponding violation.</p><p>The
 algorithm produces both disjoint and overlapping community assignments.
  The nodes will be recolored to correspond to the disjoint community 
assignments.  In the results box, the disjoint assignments will be 
listed followed by a binary matrix of the overlapping assignments.  Each
 row in the matrix represents a node and the columns are the communities
 (ones mark the community to which the node is assigned).</p>
			<h3>3 - find influential nodes</h3>
				<p>Influential nodes are those nodes that are positioned well in the
 network to apply their influence to many other nodes.  For example, in a
 social network, an influential node is a person who is capable of 
convincing others to adopt an idea or new product.  The algorithm in the
 netAnalyzer is the brute-force approach of Kempe, et al., 2005.  This 
assumes a linear thresholds model with a fixed probability of 
activation.  User needs to enter the number of influential nodes to 
select, the activation probability and the number of iterations.  
Increasing the number of iterations will result in a more accurate 
result but will linearly slow down the calculation.</p><p>The results 
box lists the nodes with the most influence.  Also, the nodes in the 
canvas are all changed to black with the influential ones painted red.</p>
			<h3>4 - predict the class of an unlabeled node</h3>
				<p>Node prediction or link-based classification is the process of 
predicting the class of a node given labeled instances, the graph and 
attributes.  As an example, given a social network with some demographic
 attributes and a class, in this case, political stance, the system can 
predict the political stance of nodes that are not labeled (political 
stance is unknown).  The class can be inferred by instances that are 
similar to it and also to others that it is linked to.</p><p>To be able 
to use this, you must first supply attributes and second, name one of 
the attributes "class" (the one you wish to predict).  The algorithm is 
based on the logistic regression model of Lu and Getoor.  There are only
 two parameters, a coefficient for data and another for links.  This way
 you can weight the attributes and links.  Say that you think that the 
attributes contain more predictive information.  Then you can enter 
numbers like 2 for data coef and 1 for link coef.  At this point in 
time, the algorithm only allows 2 classes: 1 and -1.</p><p>When you run 
this algorithm, the nodes in the canvas will be painted according to 
their class.  The predicted nodes will then be painted with the color of
 the class that it predicts for them and highlighted.  The results box 
will also display the results of the predictions.</p>
			<h3>5 - predict the most likely links to be made next</h3>
				<p>Link prediction is the process of predicting which currently 
not-linked node pairs will become linked next.  This algorithm based on 
the paper by Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg, simply computes similarity 
metrics for all non-linked node pairs and chooses the pairs with the 
optimum values.  At this time the only metrics implemented are 
common-neighbors and Jaccard.  To run the algorithm, enter the number of
 links you want to predict and which metric to use.  The results box 
will list the node pairs chosen and the predicted links will be 
displayed in red on the canvas.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<h2>Layouts</h2><p>Choosing a layout can help to organize the nodes 
into a pattern to make it easier to distinguish the structure of the 
network.  Choosing one of the options will reorganize the nodes and 
redraw the network.</p>
			<h3>Random</h3><p>This option, simply chooses a random position for each node.</p>
			<h3>Circle</h3><p>Places the nodes into a circle in the order that the nodes are originally read in.</p>
			<h3>Community circle</h3><p>Each community is organized into a circle and those circles are arranged in a larger circle.</p>
			<h3>Fructerman Reingold</h3><p>Force-based algorithm that iteratively
 moves nodes until they settle into an arrangement that places nodes 
close to their neighbors.  This algorithm is stochastic so a different 
pattern will emerge after each run.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<h2>Generating graphs</h2><p></p>
			<h3>Random</h3><p>Based on the graphs by Erdos and Renyi.  Enter the 
number of nodes in the network and the probability that any two nodes 
will become linked.</p>
			<h3>Small world</h3><p>Small world networks were first identified by 
Watts and Strogatz.  To build a small world graph, you start with a 
regular graph and rewire the links.  A regular graph is one where each 
node has an identical degree.  For this algorithm, enter the number of 
nodes, the probability of rewiring and the number of neighbors.  First 
the algorithm builds a regular graph using the number of neighbors 
entered.  Then it rewires each link with the probability entered.</p>
			<h3>Scale-free</h3><p>Barabasi and his associates proposed the 
scale-free model of network formation.  Scale-free networks have a 
degree distribution that follows a power law curve.  The principle of 
preferential attachment guides the algorithm.  This means that nodes 
will link to others based on a probability proportional to their degree.
  Enter the number of nodes in the network, the probability and the 
number of links.  The links will be added based on preferential 
attachment weighted by the probability.  Probability can be between 0 
and 1, with 0 meaning the links will be placed completely randomly and 1
 means that the process is completely governed by preferential 
attachment.</p>
